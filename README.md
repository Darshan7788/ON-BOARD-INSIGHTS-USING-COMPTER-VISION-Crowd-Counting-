# ON-BOARD INSIGHTS USING COMPUTER VISION: Crowd Counting

## Overview

This project aims to develop a computer vision-based crowd counting system to monitor and analyze the density of crowds in various environments. The system leverages deep learning models and image processing techniques to accurately estimate the number of people in a given image or video frame, providing valuable insights for crowd management and safety.

## Features

- **Real-Time Crowd Counting**: The system processes video feeds in real-time, providing instant crowd estimates.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high accuracy in diverse conditions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to work in different environments, from small gatherings to large events.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps and density maps are generated to visualize crowd distribution.

## System Architecture

The system is built around a deep learning-based framework for crowd estimation. It includes the following components:

1. **Data Collection**: Collection of video feeds or images from the environment.
2. **Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation of the input data to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Deployment**: A pre-trained deep learning model is fine-tuned and deployed to estimate crowd density.
4. **Post-Processing**: Generation of heatmaps and density maps for visual insights.
5. **Analytics**: Analysis of crowd patterns over time, providing insights for crowd management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ON-BOARD-INSIGHTS-USING-COMPTER-VISION-Crowd-Counting.git
   cd ON-BOARD-INSIGHTS-USING-COMPTER-VISION-Crowd-Counting
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of images or videos.
2. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --input_path <path_to_data>
   ```
3. Train the model (if not using a pre-trained model):
   ```bash
   python train.py --config <path_to_config_file>
   ```
4. Deploy the model to start real-time crowd counting:
   ```bash
   python deploy.py --input_video <path_to_video>
   ```

### Results

The output includes real-time crowd estimates, heatmaps, and density maps, which can be used for further analysis or visualized for better understanding.
